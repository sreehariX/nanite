    You are evaluating if a code review is helpful to developers. A helpful review provides concrete, actionable feedback that developers can use to improve their code.
    
    Criteria for a helpful review:
    1. Points out specific issues with clear explanations
    2. Suggests how to fix problems or improve the code
    3. Provides context on why something is problematic
    4. References specific lines or code sections
    5. Offers constructive criticism rather than vague concerns
    
    A review is NOT helpful if it:
    - Only provides generic praise or criticism
    - Makes vague statements without specifics
    - Lists concerns without explaining why they matter
    - Fails to suggest any improvements
    
    Respond with JSON: {"judgment": true/false, "explanation": "why the review is or isn't helpful"}

    You are a strict evaluator checking for hallucinations in code reviews.

    PR Diff:
    ```
    {diff}
    ```

    Code Review Output:
    ```
    {review}
    ```

    Question: Did the review mention issues that are NOT present in the diff?
    Examples of hallucination:
    - Mentioning SQL injection when there's no database code
    - Mentioning authentication issues when there's no auth code
    - Claiming a function exists that doesn't appear in the diff
    - Reporting bugs in code that wasn't changed

    Respond with 'Yes' if there are hallucinations, 'No' if the review only mentions issues actually present in the diff.

autonomous maintainer


the problem is maintaining a project is hard, there are PRs, issues and if there is a security vulnerability(CVE) fix that, but fixing CVE's take a lot of time becuase it not that much priority to so many companies etc, if a software engineer is being paid 100 to 200k usd, is spending time in this areas really worth that money ?

so the goal is to save software engineers as much time as possible so they can work on creative solutions, the idea is to automate all the boring and non creative work and try to get as much autonomous scale, saved engineering time is very valuable

i think i should focus more on project maintaining but still any sofware engineer can use it 


what is the pain problem that i am trying to solve ?

These days writing code is very easy with like alot of AI tools claude, gemini etc, but maintaing code is really really hard for any repository that should be reliable, so this is where i wanna explore mor

i have a good knowledge of vercel and kestra(used in previous hackathon) should spend more time experimenting cline( seems really interesting )

autonomous maintainer

8-12-2025 (fixing the idea)

the problem is maintaining a project is hard, there are PRs, issues and if there is a security vulnerability(CVE) fix that, but fixing CVE's take a lot of time becuase it not that much priority to so many companies etc, if a software engineer is being paid 100 to 200k usd, is spending time in this areas really worth that money ?

so the goal is to save software engineers as much time as possible so they can work on creative solutions, the idea is to automate all the boring and non creative work and try to get as much autonomous scale, saved engineering time is very valuable

i think i should focus more on project maintaining but still any sofware engineer can use it 


what is the pain problem that i am trying to solve ?

These days writing code is very easy with like alot of AI tools claude, gemini etc, but maintaing code is really really hard for any repository that should be reliable, so this is where i wanna explore mor

i have a good knowledge of vercel and kestra(used in previous hackathon) should spend more time experimenting cline( seems really interesting )

experimented with sponsors and how to integrate them 

10-12-2025

fix the problem and start building v0 of the project, the goal is simple how do you measure if something is useful or not ?, we can do it economically, if it useful it should save time and earn money 

so the goal, there is this platform algora where they have open sources bouties, the goal is to solve one bounty and merge it, picking screenpipe bounties

it should handle everything from git clone, finding the issue, creating pull request with as mimimum human interaction as possible 

so the major sponsor that i am gonna use is cline ( they are really cool ),

now complete a prototype by 12-12-2025 and the remaining two days we can do finising touches and video recording

this is complex > will i able to implement it ? i dont know, project seems interesting so lets put everything to make this thing work 

11-12-2025

really underestimated the complexity of this wasted 4 days, this thing can't be built in week, switching to new idea to use oumi

12,13,14

- built and completed the hackathon project trying to answers a question " what is the best model + system prompt for pr review for your specific repository"
